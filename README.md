# Cobalt Core Kestrel Mod
## About
- This mod adds the Kestrel cruiser from FTL: Faster Than Light into the Cobalt Core game.
- Includes two cards unique to the Kestrel cruiser: Burst Laser which fires three shots for two energy, Artemis missile which fires one piercing shot and a 2 DMG missile for one energy.
- This mod is in hiatus due to changes in life and personal commitments, please do not send me bug reports as I do not have time to maintain this mod. 

## Definitely need to add this list
- Implement status counter to track Burst Laser charging - Done
- Modify weapon charge status counter to display as bars instead of numbers.
- Implement missile that does piercing damage
- Implement artifact counter that tracks missile count

## Maybe add this list
- Implement explosive replicator artifact that generates 1-2 missiles per jump
- Implement hull smasher laser artifact (boss artifact?) that replaces federation laser/burst laser.

## Loading this mod
- This mod requires the legacy [EWanderer's Cobalt Core Modloader](https://github.com/Ewanderer/CobaltCoreModLoader)
- Download the zip file containing the DLL and sprite files and add the path of the DLL in the modloader UI.
- Future updates and releases will use [Shockah's Nickel Modloader](https://github.com/Shockah/Nickel)
