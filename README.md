# Cobalt Core Kestrel Mod
## About
This mod adds the Kestrel cruiser from FTL: Faster Than Light into the Cobalt Core game.

## Definitely need to add this list
- Implement status counter to track Burst Laser charging - Done
- Modify weapon charge status counter to display as bars instead of numbers.
- Implement missile that does piercing damage
- Implement artifact counter that tracks missile count

## Maybe add this list
- Implement explosive replicator artifact that generates 1-2 missiles per jump
- Implement hull smasher laser artifact (boss artifact?) that replaces federation laser/burst laser.

## 2024 Status
- This mod is in hiatus due to changes in life and personal commitments.
